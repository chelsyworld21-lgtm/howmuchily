`Dear Cuppy,

Today is your birthday! Happy birthday! I know you don’t celebrate anymore, but I still do, and that won’t be changing any time soon. An ocean of miles may lie between us, but I will bridge it with every bit of love I can send your way because you deserve to be celebrated.

It has been 459 days since you and I became a team. I may not be able to walk you through each one of these days, but I will try to encapsulate how all they have felt with you.

More than any other location or memory, you are where I feel like I truly belong. Being with you, in whatever form, feels like the final, weary, and wonderful exhale of arriving home after a very long journey. You are the equivalent of coming home. You are home to me. The moment I am with you, no matter how bad, long, happy or boring the day has been for me, it feels like walking through a door I've walked through thousands of times into a place of comfort, so much love and understanding. A foundation that has not once wavered.

I always tell you how pretty your eyes are and they are, so so beautiful, but it’s always been more than their color. Looking into those eyes, the whole world settles. I feel calm and loved in a way that is my truest home. A more genuine truth of the matter is, your eyes are merely a reflection of a much more beautiful heart and soul behind them. Being loved by you has not merely made me happy; it feels like I have really won. It is a deep and humbling victory.

Thank you for loving me rightly, for listening, for caring, for the man you are, and for all the memories we have built. I hold each one of them deeply within my heart. I am so incredibly glad to be on this journey with you, and the luckiest girl in the world to be walking it with you.

I love you beyond measure and deep within my soul until the end of time. No matter what, I will never, ever not love you. Now, I do not know what shape our future takes or even if such a thing really exists, I merely know for sure what may come along but I hope we can face it together. And if the road ends, well, that will be little consolation because I will have known love from one of the finest, most amazing people to ever walk this earth. Not for one second have I ever regretted being with you, not now, not ever.
I have become so much more just by being with you. You have helped me in ways I don't even think you realize, with the calm wisdom that always knows what is right to say or do. I am so very grateful. I cannot picture loving anyone else the way I do you, Cuppy. The very thought is impossible. Absurd even.

I could go on for pages. But today, I want to say the very thing that matters the most: I love you, and I wish you a truly happy birthday.

All my heart and love, 
Your Muffin 💌`,
